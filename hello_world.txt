hello, i created this file to test my git and github skills!
This is an update line
another update for ya

In this one, I will testing out the importance of good git commit messages.

There are 7 rules to a good git commit message:
    Separate subject from body with a blank line
    Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    Capitalize the subject line
    Do not end the subject line with a period
    Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    Wrap the body at 72 characters
    Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
